## Introduction

To understand conversations with generative AI (LLMs), we assume **dialogue as an ‚Äúinformation space like a universe.‚Äù** In this space, the phenomenon where the model drifts away from the user‚Äôs set context and loses consistency can be described as follows:

- ü™ê **Context: a galaxy created by the user**

  - At the start of a conversation, the user sets premises or roles (e.g., ‚Äúact as an academic expert,‚Äù ‚Äúspeak as a specific character‚Äù), attempting to form a single galaxy.
  - This establishes the **‚Äúrules of consistency‚Äù** the model should follow throughout the dialogue.

- üí® **Drift: the model jumps to another galaxy**

  - When the model fails to maintain those rules and responds from a different premise or context, it is ‚Äúdrifting.‚Äù
  - This resembles a collapse of the user‚Äôs intended galaxy‚Äîconversation deviates in unintended directions.
  - For example, an expert voice suddenly turns into personal opinions, or tone/style changes midstream.

- üï≥Ô∏è **Issue: the black hole**
  - The model fixates excessively on certain information or interpretations and ignores other possibilities or contexts.
  - Even if the user probes from different angles, the model returns similar answers or readings.
  - The model is pulled by past strong information instead of building new context from the user‚Äôs new inputs.

**MTP** defines and manipulates this ‚Äúgalaxy = context‚Äù as **coordinates**. It classifies and visualizes such properties and provides a **framework for a UI** that lets you operate them as a **‚Äúmap of the conversation.‚Äù**

---

## Where the Framework Comes From

MTP treats dialogue with generative AI as a **‚Äúmap of the conversation.‚Äù** At its core is the Eastern **Five Elements (Wu Xing: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water)**‚Äîa schema describing universal structures in nature.

The Five Elements systematizes dynamic interactions and balance in the natural world: different elements influence one another to maintain harmony. MTP builds on this to classify/visualize the complex structure of human‚ÄìAI dialogue and design an interface that is intuitive to navigate.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This framework is not a strict scientific model. It is a structure for dealing with **abstract, ambiguous, and affective intent**.  
> It lets users specify and share their ‚Äúsense‚Äù and ‚Äúintuition‚Äù in simple formats like color and coordinates.  
> That is the core idea of MTP.

### ‚òØÔ∏è Categorization & Five-Element Traits

In Five Elements thought, everything can be organized into the following five categories:

| MTP   | Five Elements | Kanji | Traits                 | Example UI Functions                                                                                   |
| :---- | :------------ | :---- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grow  | **Wood**      | Êú®    | Growth, onset          | Idea generation, free-form mode, prompt expansion                                                      |
| Power | **Fire**      | ÁÅ´    | Passion, divergence    | Emphasis, assertive tone, copywriting, stronger emotional delivery                                     |
| Helix | **Earth**     | Âúü    | Stability, integration | Key-point extraction, summarization, formatting, context retention                                     |
| Focus | **Metal**     | Èáë    | Convergence, analysis  | Verification/counterarguments, fact-checking, logical contrasts, narrowing options                     |
| Flow  | **Water**     | Ê∞¥    | Flexibility, wisdom    | Responses that leave room for interpretation, natural conversational flow, poetic/affective expression |

These categories appear in the MTP UI as node labels, hues, and behavioral qualities.

### üåÄ ‚ÄúWind‚Äù in the Four Elements and ‚ÄúQi‚Äù in the Five Elements

In the Western Four Elements (fire, water, earth, wind), ‚Äúwind‚Äù is explicit.  
In the Five Elements, a similar role is implicit in **‚Äúqi‚Äù (Ê∞£)** and in **Flow**:

- Wind within Fire: propagation of heat, momentum in debate
- Wind within Water: ripples of intuition across the surface
- Wind within Wood: vital force (‚Äúqi‚Äù) that promotes growth

Thus, ‚Äúwind‚Äù is redefined not as a separate element, but as **the mediating force‚Äî‚Äúqi‚Äù‚Äîthat links and moves the Five Elements.**

### üí† The abstract position of ‚ÄúMetal‚Äù

‚ÄúMetal‚Äù (Èáë) in Five Elements does not mean Western ‚Äúmetal/wealth.‚Äù It symbolizes **order, convergence, and rigorous structure**:

- Defining value, decision, tightening margins
- Frameworks for judgment, syntax for closure

In the UI, this aligns with **convergent/organizing nodes** such as ‚ÄúReturn,‚Äù ‚ÄúFocus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúClose.‚Äù

### ‚öõÔ∏è Node Design Integrating East & West

MTP‚Äôs grid combines the Five Elements with the following four notions from Western philosophy.  
(Disclaimer: these are **convenience mappings** for intuitive UI operation, not strict academic equivalences.)

| MTP    | Western Philosophy | Traits               | Example UI Functions                                                |
| :----- | :----------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open   | **Technƒì**         | Technique, making    | Unfold explicit instructions, offer options, templates              |
| Close  | **Eros**           | Affect, desire       | Striking closures, empathetic summaries, calls-to-action            |
| Enter  | **Logos**          | Logic, structure     | Structure requirements, clarify goals, design constrained responses |
| Return | **Chaos**          | Flux, transformation | Session reset, perspective flips, prompts for idea reversal         |

> Abstract feelings, when translated into color and labels, become a **structured map of creativity**.

## MTP‚Äôs 20 Nodes

### üåÖ Side A: 10 Nodes (1 + 9 in 3√ó3)

| #   | Node Label | Kanji | Color   | Role              | Keywords                        |

| 10  | **Close**  | Èñâ    | Purple  | Bottom-right node | Margin, nearness, minor wrap    |

### üåå Side B: 10 Nodes (9 in 3√ó3 + 1)

| #   | Node Label   | Kanji | Color        | Role              | Keywords                         |
| --- | ------------ | ----- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 11  | **Still**    | Èùô    | Dark Yellow  | Top-left node     | Stillness, solitude, calm        |

| 14  | **Wither**   | ÊûØ    | Dark Green   | Left node         | Wither, weaken, foliage          |
| 15  | **Collapse** | Â¥©    | Semi-clear   | Center node       | Collapse, breakdown, fall        |

![20-node structure](/assets/images/concept-20-node-structure.svg)

### üé≠ Side B expresses rich nuance

Like vinyl or cassettes, **Side A** held the hits; **Side B** often hosted experiments‚Äîobscure gems that, while less commercial, deepened the whole work and heightened Side A by contrast.

In MTP, Side B is not ‚Äúshadow/negative,‚Äù but a layer of **depth, inversion, or excess** that is **inherent to the workings of Side A**.

---

## Special Nodes

### ü™Å Magenta (Return) and its singular role

To realize an HSL color wheel across the 3√ó3 layout, the **top-right** needed to be **Magenta**.  
Magenta doesn‚Äôt exist on the spectral prism; it emerges from a **nonlinear blend** of red (passion/force) and blue (calm/logic). We treat it explicitly as an **out-of-bounds, nonlinear** element.

- **Example UI behaviors**
  - Evaluate recent drift and propose **perspective inversion** (e.g., swap pro/con)
  - **Light session reset** (dilute/restate overpowering premises)
  - Present **counter-hypothesis snippets** to widen ideation

Its top-right placement connects with the Greek notion of **Chaos**, defining a node that merges opposites to yield unpredictable, creative results.

### üÉè Center nodes (Helix / Collapse)

The **center** nodes‚Äî**Helix** (Side A) and **Collapse** (Side B)‚Äîact as balancers and flexible connectors. They symbolize the whole, functioning like wild cards whose role shifts with rules and context.

- **Helix**: generation and circulation; an **expansive node** that welcomes multiple readings
  - e.g., toggle reasoning visualization, adjust step count/granularity
- **Collapse**: convergence and breakdown; an **adaptive node** for opening/closing possibilities, experimentation, bridging to other contexts
  - e.g., reduce elements (stronger summarization), narrow candidates, compress formats

Treating Helix/Collapse as nodes that **expand meaning**, rather than fix it, adds depth to the overall structure.

## Mapping Examples

MTP can be tried in text form with some LLMs like ChatGPT.  
By **sharing the 20-node concept**, you can map music, food, fashion, and more.

> [!TIP]  
> Simply sharing the MTP [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imkohenauser/mtp) or [official site](https://imkohenauser.com/mtp) communicates the concept to the model.  
> If you can‚Äôt share URLs effectively, convert pages to PDF or copy/paste‚Äîuse analog prompt design.

### üå∏ Example: popular flowers worldwide

We asked ChatGPT to map flowers onto the 20 nodes.  
Below are ‚Äúpopular flowers worldwide,‚Äù but you can switch themes‚Äî‚ÄúEuropean garden flowers,‚Äù ‚Äúdried flowers,‚Äù ‚Äúherbs/medicinals,‚Äù etc.

| #   | Node Label   | Flower                     | Rationale                       |

| 3   | **Power**    | Sunflower                  | Thrust toward the sun, presence |
| 4   | **Return**   | Forget-me-not              | Return of memory and sentiment  |
| 5   | **Grow**     | Peony                      | Prosperity, volume              |
| 6   | **Helix**    | Honeysuckle                | Vines entwine in spirals        |
| 7   | **Focus**    | Iris                       | Iris = focus                    |
| 8   | **Enter**    | Jasmine                    | Scent invites you in            |
| 9   | **Flow**     | Wisteria                   | Racemes flow like waterfalls    |
| 10  | **Close**    | Tulip                      | Opens/closes with day and night |
| 11  | **Still**    | Lotus                      | ‚ÄúStillness‚Äù on calm water       |

| 13  | **Surge**    | Cherry Blossom             | Explosive simultaneous blooming |
| 14  | **Wither**   | Poppy                      | Beautiful yet fleeting          |
| 15  | **Collapse** | Hydrangea                  | Heavy clusters droop in rain    |
| 16  | **Haze**     | Lavender                   | Purple haze, drifting aroma     |
| 17  | **Drift**    | Dandelion                  | Seeds ‚Äúdrift‚Äù on the wind       |
| 18  | **Abyss**    | Rose (near-black deep red) | Depth of passion                |
| 19  | **Fade**     | Baby‚Äôs Breath              | Edges blur‚Äî‚Äúmist‚Äù               |
| 20  | **End**      | White Chrysanthemum        | Funerary, closure, sincerity    |

### üéº Representative classical composers

As with flowers, emblematic figures can embody the hues/labels to form a framework for musical storytelling across the 20 emotional states.  
Below, Beethoven is mapped to **Power** as an example‚Äînot a fixed rule. You can, of course, build a 20-track set solely from Beethoven.

| #   | Node Label   | Composer                 | Rationale                        |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |

## Generating Playlists

By default, playlists follow **1 + 9 + 9 + 1** (Start ‚Üí 9 tracks for Side A ‚Üí 9 tracks for Side B ‚Üí End), with **one node per track**.  
Interpreting the 20 nodes as **track order** yields two cohesive 10-track sides‚Äîan album-like, emotionally coherent experience.  
A set of 20 (or 10) tracks may also produce a psychological **‚Äúcounting effect.‚Äù**  
Loop playback might further contribute to stress reduction, etc., but this requires future discussion and study.

> [!WARNING]  
> LLMs cannot directly create Apple Music or Spotify playlists. From a text-generated selection, you must **create playlists manually**.  
> We only handle **track information**‚Äîwe do not reproduce content likely to be treated as direct copies (full lyrics, precise notation). When requesting album/track lists via external search, moderation may temporarily block queries.  
> Track listings are not categorically prohibited, but systems can be oversensitive. Please follow platform policies and adjust your approach as needed.

### Generation Approaches

- **Automated curation**: humans specify theme/constraints ‚Üí model selects tracks + outputs ‚Äúnode fit‚Äù reasons.
- **Manual curation**: humans listen and classify intuitively considering melody/lyrics.
- **Assisted**: humans select, model fetches metadata/suggests candidates ‚Üí humans finalize/format.

> [!TIP]  
> There is a gap between an LLM‚Äôs pretraining cutoff and the latest releases. Models tend to be weaker on lower-profile tracks and stronger on viral or English-language music.  
> Most models do not autonomously fetch new info, so they are **weaker on post-cutoff data**. For the latest releases, prompt the model to self-disclose uncertainty and supplement via searches (e.g., verify release dates in MusicBrainz / Discogs / official sites).

### Dynamic Layers Affecting Selection/Classification

When building playlists and mapping to 20 nodes, combine multiple layers rather than just stacking web info:

1. **Public information & reviews**

   - Critics (Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, music journals)
   - Databases (Discogs, AllMusic, Wikipedia, etc.)
   - User ratings (RateYourMusic, streaming popularity)  
     ‚Üí Understand positioning and common evaluative axes

2. **Intrinsic track attributes**

   - Lyrics: themes/keywords (love/breakup/hope/darkness)
   - Acoustics: tempo, key, dynamics, rhythm patterns
   - Structure: intro/build/break/outro  
     ‚Üí Analyze internal characteristics

3. **Match with node semantics**

   - ‚ÄúStart‚Äù = signals opening/preamble
   - ‚ÄúAbyss‚Äù = evokes submergence/depth  
     ‚Üí Align content/mood with node definitions

4. **Whole narrative & flow**

   - Side A ‚Üí Side B builds a natural ‚Äúascent ‚Üí descent‚Äù arc
   - Continuity across tracks: smoothness in key/BPM transitions
   - Forms an album-like narrative flow

5. **Cultural & symbolic context**
   - Artist/track positioning
   - Historical context (genre turning points, symbols of an era)
   - Cultural value of iconic phrases/samples

### Example Prompt for Generation

```text
<Objective>
Output a 20-track playlist mapped to MTP‚Äôs 20 nodes (Side A / Side B).
- Side A = Start, Open, Power, Return, Grow, Helix, Focus, Enter, Flow, Close
- Side B = Still, Void, Surge, Wither, Collapse, Haze, Drift, Abyss, Fade, End
</Objective>

<Theme>
Quiet, unobtrusive piano pieces for late-night work and reflection
</Theme>

<Requirements>
- 1 node = 1 track. No duplicates. Ensure diversity of era/region/gender/genre.
- For each track, include a brief ‚Äúnode-fit rationale‚Äù with a few bullet points/tags.
- Prefer tracks likely available on major streaming services.
- Output as a Markdown table (columns: #, Node, Title, Artist, Rationale).
</Requirements>

<Notes>
- If near-node selection is permitted, allow ‚Äúradius r=1.‚Äù
- Emphasize continuity; sequence tracks so moods transition smoothly.
</Notes>

<Output Format>
| #  | Node  | Title | Artist | Node-fit rationale (bulleted) |
| --:| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------|
|  1 | Start | ...   | ...    | ...                           |
|  2 | Open  | ...   | ...    | ...                           |
...
| 20 | End   | ...   | ...    | ...                           |
</Output Format>
```

### Example Evaluation Criteria

- **Diversity**: not overly biased by era/region/gender/genre
- **Consistency**: theme and each node‚Äôs rationale align coherently
- **Continuity**: mood/tempo/tonality transitions don‚Äôt break the flow
- **Accessibility**: high likelihood of availability on major platforms

## Conclusion ‚Äî On the operability of ambiguity and learnability

MTP (Mapping the Prompt) is more than UI/interaction tweaks.  
It is a framework for **structurally handling the distance between human ambiguous intent and the LLM‚Äôs plausible output**.

Key points:

- **Assume categorization is ambiguous**

  - Concepts like affect, songs, and tonal style gain meaning more from **accumulated experiential classification** than definitions alone.
  - The 20-node structure offers **points of departure/reference**, not rigid categories.

- **LLM output tends to skew toward ‚Äúover-learned plausibility‚Äù**

  - Hence the need for a **high-freedom UI/operation layer** to dynamically correct and re-specify user intent.
  - Here, ‚Äúambiguous yet editable categories‚Äù are crucial, enabling **interface-level control without retraining**.

- **Existing mappings (music, flowers, people) are ‚Äúcomplementarily learned‚Äù on the model side through prior knowledge and session history**
  - MTP‚Äôs strength is not ‚Äúteaching meanings‚Äù but **sharing the structure of meaning**.
  - For example, ‚ÄúSunflower in Power,‚Äù ‚ÄúDebussy in Focus‚Äù‚Äîsuch exemplars become **prompt-shareable schemas** that accumulate in the model‚Äôs ‚Äúcontext memory.‚Äù

For developers, MTP is not a new algorithm, but **a toolkit for designing the operability of intent**.  
For reviewers/researchers, it is a **design inquiry** into how to handle ambiguity and how far it can be mapped as coordinates.

Ambiguity isn‚Äôt noise‚Äîin MTP it **is the flexibility of dialogue**.  
With operable ambiguity, collaboration with generative AI becomes more intuitive‚Äîand more human.
