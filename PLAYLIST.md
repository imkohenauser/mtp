## üóæ Japan Playlists

I also publish special playlists of Japanese songs.  
Since I carefully classify Japanese lyrics and emotional expressions, each node‚Äôs characteristics may be easier to imagine.  
Among them, Hikaru Utada‚Äôs works are especially suitable for classification, and I have organized them into a 40-song structure:  
**1+9 (A1) + 9+1 (B1) + 1+9 (A2) + 9+1 (B2)**.
