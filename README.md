**Mapping the Prompt (MTP)** is a **lightweight, general-purpose framework** for visualizing conversational states with generative AI (LLM) as coordinates, enabling alignment of intent and prompt adjustment.  
It assumes a minimal implementation with SVG/CSS/JS, and treats dialogue as a ‚Äúcoordinate space,‚Äù replacing fine-grained textual instructions with **UI operations (points + averages)**.  
For details, see [Concept](./CONCEPT.md) and the [Official Website](https://imkohenauser.com/mtp).

**Features**

- ü§ù **A shared framework between generative AI and users**

  - MTP is not a new NLP algorithm but a **lightweight coordinate framework** shareable by both users and generative AI.
  - Abstract or intuitive intent can be expressed not through text input but through **coordinate specification**.

- ‚òØÔ∏è **20-node classification (like A/B sides of a record or cassette)**

  - Side A: Start, Open, Power, Return, Grow, Helix, Focus, Enter, Flow, Close.
  - Side B: Still, Void, Surge, Wither, Collapse, Haze, Drift, Abyss, Fade, End.

- üöÄ **Model-agnostic and adaptive**

  - Usable without large-scale retraining‚Äîonly lightweight mapping learning, prompt tuning, or fine-tuning.
  - Applicable to major LLMs (OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepMind / xAI, etc.).
  - Mapping can be adjusted to match each model‚Äôs **principles and safety policies**.

- ü´ß **Positioned as a lightweight UI layer**

  - Placed near the input form: a ‚Äúcoordinate UI‚Äù toggle next to the chat box.
  - As part of multimodal output: generative AI can render the coordinate UI, which the user then adjusts.

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is in its early (alpha) stage.  
> The goal is a shared UI usable across major generative AI models. Collaboration and feedback are welcome.

## Introduction

Generative AI users routinely seek diverse intentions such as:

- Specifying tone/context precisely in prompt design
- Inspiring creative stories, poetry, or free-form writing
- Producing clear, persuasive summaries or business documents
- Delivering bold, powerful proposals or copy
- Explaining complex information in smooth, accessible prose

But issuing exact textual instructions each time is cumbersome, and ambiguity or mismatched interpretation often arises.  
**MTP** provides a UI to specify abstract or intuitive intent as **coordinates**, enabling trial-and-error adjustment **visually in an instant** (e.g., divergence ‚áÑ convergence, force ‚áÑ flow).

## Concept (Overview)

### Classification Concept ‚Äî 20-Node Structure

MTP is designed as a classification of 20 nodes, arranged like cassette tape sides: 10 on Side A and 10 on Side B.

- One unique feature is treating the UI handle, the ‚ÄúGizmo,‚Äù as independent nodes (Start / End).
- **Side A** covers clarity and forward movement. **Side B** provides **depth, reverse aspects, and complementary nuances**.
- Side B is not ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù but an extension of nuance and expression.

### UI Operation ‚Äî Style by Coordinates

On the UI, behavior is adjusted by **coordinate specification**:

- **Vertex**: Anchor points representing features of a prompt.
- **Gizmo**: **Average coordinate** of multiple vertices; the session‚Äôs center of gravity and main UI handle.
- **Transformed Gizmo**: The user‚Äôs **target coordinate** to directly control output tone/behavior.

![UI operation by coordinates](/assets/images/readme-ui-operation.svg)

### Grid and Abstraction

Internally, states are tracked on a strict grid (e.g., 19√ó19), while the UI can abstract into **color wheels or simplified palettes**.  
Grid configuration can adapt to devices or display areas.

![Grid and abstraction](/assets/images/readme-grid-and-abstraction.svg)

### Session State Visualization

User‚ÄìAI session states (history, phase) can be visualized as **coordinate transitions**.  
Session drift (deviation from intent) can be spotted at a glance, enabling return to or alignment with past ‚Äúgood states.‚Äù

## Use Cases

Enhancing creative tasks and long-form dialogues, while enabling finer control of tone and style, within model design/constraints.

### Tone Context (Instant Style Switching)

Controls **attitude, affect, and tone** axes in generated text.

- Example: empathetic listener, robotic, passionate, calm ‚Äî adjustable as hues or vector directions.
- Users can combine tones, e.g., ‚Äúpolite but dry,‚Äù ‚Äúfriendly and passionate.‚Äù

#### Intuitive Style Switching

- _Open √ó Grow_: Idea generation, brainstorming, poetic openings
- _Power √ó Void_: Strong persuasion (marketing copy)
- _Return √ó Focus_: Summaries, executive digests, proposal outlines

### Visualizing ChatGPT Personas

Simple persona styles (e.g., Cynic, Listener, Robot, Nerd) can be mapped, adjusted, and drift-controlled.

### Reasoning Level (Depth and Granularity)

Controls **thinking cost and structure** in output:

- Center: quick answers, low-cost, key points only.
- Outer coordinates: multi-step reasoning, comparisons, counterarguments, explicit intentions.

<details>
<summary>Node examples and tendencies</summary>

| Node      | Reasoning Tendency    |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| **Power** | Active reasoning      |
| **Flow**  | Minimal, concise      |
| **Grow**  | Divergent exploration |
| **Focus** | Narrow, deep probing  |

</details>

### Multi-Step Reasoning (Process Visualization)

Multi-step reasoning (chain-of-thought) can be visualized and adjusted via **coordinates and color**:

- Internal steps of the LLM (prompt reasoning transitions) shown as color trails or phases.
- Keywords anchored as vertices (coordinates/colors).
- Users can revisit vertices (past steps) to **revise course**.

This makes LLM outputs transparent and debuggable via **UI-based, non-verbal instructions**.

---

## Implementation Policy (Minimal Setup)

- **Rendering**: SVG base; CSS for color; JS for events (drag, click, hover).
- **State/Coordinates**: Vertex (classified points), Gizmo (session centroid), Transformed Gizmo (target).
- **External Integration**: Prompt/parameter conversion to AI APIs via loose adapters.
- **Fallback**: Functions as a **standalone UI** (color/graphics only) for demo/learning purposes.

## Conclusion ‚Äî Between Intent and Plausibility

Getting ‚Äúplausible‚Äù responses from AI has become easy with technical advances.  
But reflecting **personal nuance and affective subtlety** remains a challenge.

Long, detailed prompts can introduce ambiguity, losing subtle intent.  
**Mapping the Prompt (MTP)** offers a new approach to resolve this mismatch.

Instead of retraining AI, MTP **converts users‚Äô intuitive mental maps into coordinates AI can interpret**, replacing trial-and-error with direct manipulation.  
Vague requests like ‚Äúmore passionate‚Äù or ‚Äúa bit quieter‚Äù become vectors in coordinate space, enabling **a visually shared interface** that elevates dialogue quality.

MTP adds an ‚Äúintent-sharing‚Äù layer to human‚ÄìAI dialogue.  
It is not merely a UI but a **cultural and cognitive proposal**, aiming to become a **future standard interface** for generative AI.
